"Congratulations, Hans, Mary. It's a boy..."

</p1><br><br><p1>It was the seemingly muffled voice that I heard after I woke up from my deep slumber. I was actually confused of what's happening around me because the last thing I remember before I lost my consciousness was being beaten on the road by a few people.

</p1><br><br><p1>The voices of excitement that filled the room slowly became clearer in my ears, just like how the blurred sight when I first opened my eyes was also replaced by the bright lucid view of my surroundings. And my... In my wildest imagination, I never thought I'd experience being born as an infant, again.

</p1><br><br><p1>Did I just die back there? Or Am I just dreaming?

</p1><br><br><p1>But this too vivid for a dream. Wait a moment...

</p1><br><br><p1>Is this perhaps... what they call Reincarnation? Oh my God! Hohoho...

</p1><br><br><p1>I never once thought such a strange occurrence could happen but confirming this unbelievable phenomenon has got me completely astounded. I'd say, there is really no point wondering why I'm currently feeling enthusiastic because any science fan like myself would find a real reincarnation event as fascinating and... mind-blowing. Woah...

</p1><br><br><p1>Yes, I'm a big fan of science and as a matter of fact, I was a physicist in my previous life. I had felt proud about myself and my great accomplishments in it. But later in my life, I became a victim of total violence by some fucking drug-addicted people on the streets and I guess my life ended there, the week before my twenty-seventh birthday! I didn't even experience what it felt like to love someone special because I dedicated my life to science, to how the universe works and other very complicated stuffs!

</p1><br><br><p1>Sorry... I was too emotional...

</p1><br><br><p1>But at this moment, I felt like I was given another chance to experience life in a better way. Maybe God has mistakenly allowed the end of my previous life so he secretly compensated me by making me reincarnate. Haha, what a nonsensical guess and unfitting of a former-life physicist.


</p1><br><br><p1>Honestly, this sort of 'reincarnation' thing is really strange. It felt like my whole previous life was a dream and my death there was like a nightmare when I woke up with this infant body.


</p1><br><br><p1>"Well hello there, Ray." I heard a short-haired man say, gently smiling as his face grew near me. I could see the joy in his brown eyes as he stared at me. I have already expected him but I'm not certain if he is my father. It would satisfy me enough if he really is my father while he looks... well... handsomely good enough... because that would mean I'll inherit some of his genes and have at least some averagely commendable phenotypic traits. Though, I still have to take my mother's genes into great consideration, and oh my, it did not disappoint me.

</p1><br><br><p1>When my father put down my infant body next to who I've assumed to be my mom, I finally got a good glimpse of her face and though she looked weary and pale after delivering me, she was extremely gorgeous.

</p1><br><br><p1>Her long dark-brown hair, blue eyes, smooth pink lips, and radiant complexion together made a face of a goddess. Not her face alone, she was entirely beautiful. I'd say, I would have been captivated and died married if I've met such a woman of beauty in my previous life.

</p1><br><br><p1>"Ray..." she spoke in her shallow voice and smiled at me.

</p1><br><br><p1>I noticed that they kept saying the word 'Ray.' It wasn't that hard to realize that such a short simple word is my name.

</p1><br><br><p1>"Ray Silverheart..." That sounded way cooler than my name in my previous life, haha...

</p1><br><br><p1>Now, the next most important thing, where the hell am I in the world? There are humans here so this is probably still the Earth that I know. My next hypothesis was that maybe I'm in a remote place that's less exposed to technological advancement, judging from the room's appearance and the way people around me dressed themselves much like characters in movies with medieval settings. Anyway, I currently have no way to prove my assumptions with this uncomfortable and uncontrollable infant body of mine, making me want to learn how to crawl soon which is impossible...

Hayss... I guess the diaper is wet again.

You know, being a baby is really boring most of the time, especially when they leave you alone in the bedroom. But the thing is, I get to enjoy some privileges, like having to stare at my beautiful mother for a long time... some 'play with me' stuffs or something... and breastfeeding...

I don't mean anything else. My mother's milk is really the best milk I've ever tasted. Trust me, babies don't lie...

A few months later, I finally gained a little control over my weak body. It was still frustrating though, especially when I'm not used to how low my stamina is. But at least I have some progress. Moreover, the times when I was always on my bed was the worst so I feel chuffed having something to keep myself busy now.

If you knew me, perhaps you'd understand how hungry I am for knowledge at this point of my life. I have this feeling that this world is different than my old one.

"Huu..." I've been trying my best to reach the top of table, holding on the wooden leg and trying to grab the book on top. But my legs were short and weak. Hopefully, my mother won't take away the book so soon.

After a few failures and rests, my overflowing perseverance has helped me to success. Unfortunately, in the end, my beautiful mother came and worriedly took the book from me because she only borrowed it from a friend. This event has nettled me but I wasn't yet being rebellious when my face was deadpan. One fact about me is that I don't desire the feeling of disappointment when I've given more than enough efforts.

I don't know for certain why she tilted her head as she stared at my face. She must've found my facial expression strange or something before she left. The next time she returned to my room, she brought a few books which instantly lit up my face. It was the first time she understood what I felt, I assumed.

I pretended to play with the book when mom was around. She had no idea I was only waiting for her leave me alone. Of course, I had to be careful not to raise any suspicion.

Just as I wished, the opportunity always comes because my parents were busy most of the time. My father had a job somewhere, I heard from their conversations, while my mother is always home doing what I don't have an idea on, maybe house chores. My lips would always curl up into a grin when they disappear at the bedroom's doorway.

These few days while I've been reading secretly, I was shocked and repeatedly astonished by some facts that I learned about this world I've reincarnated in. It turned out that this world is not the Earth that I know. There are a lot of similarities however, such as country, empire or kingdom names and cultures. However, the geography of this world is totally different and there are abandoned regions, like dead zones where various forms of dangerous and sort of 'fantastic' creatures dwell.

Mind-blowing...

Meanwhile, one of the books my mother gave me deserve more than the 'mind-blowing' comment. As a science lover, it got me absent-minded for more than three minutes. The book's contents has rendered me speechless, makes me want to piss on it. Like hell... The book just told me real magic exist in this world. Haha, I didn't want to believe it at first but after hearing some clues from my parents' conversations, I've found out that this 'magic' is actually real and very common thing in this world.

On the bright side, the existence of magic widened my curiosity about this world. In my previous life, I only see them in fantasy movies. Thus, magic rose to the top of my fascinations.

Pleased to have books to read, my best one among them was entitled 'Fundamentals of Basic Magic' by Larson Wick—a Master Professor in Northern Valen State Academy—basically because it explains most things in details and I can read it as though a science textbook. Fortunately, my parents had mistakenly assumed me loving the books as 'toys' so they didn't take them away from me, because if not, I would've used my last resort... my baby cry...

Reading books and practicing body movements, particularly on crawling faster and learning to walk with my two legs, had became part of my daily routine. At age of ten months, I became accustomed to sneaking around the other parts of house, accessing more books and other things that filled up my hunger for knowledge.

Recently, I learned that there are a total of eight Simple Attributes in magic: Fire, Water, Earth, Lightning, Air, Nature, Sound, and Light—these eight attributes are known to be the easiest to control and well-studied. Outside these eight, there are the Rare Attributes which are still mysterious and full of uncertainties, such as Healing, Aether or Space, and Shadow attributes, etc.. The specific number of Rare Attributes is not known yet and in fact, there's no established classifications for these magic attributes. Sadly, the book was centralized on Simple Attributes of magic so I didn't learn anything else about the Rare Attributes.

Aside from learning magic in its various forms, I was enlightened by some necessary magic concepts. In the early chapters of 'Fundamentals of Basic Magic' by Larson Wick, I learned about 'mana'—a mysterious form of energy that didn't exist in the Earth where I came from—and other related  things, terms, and concepts, such as Mana Realms and Mana Affinity.

It turned out, a person or any other creature must have something called a Mana Realm to be able to cast magic spells. This Mana Realm allows one to accumulate and purify mana inside one's body and is linked to one's soul and physical body, allowing one to fully control it. Mana Realms normally don't exist when an infant is born however, one has a certain potential to awaken it: Many people never awakens a Magic Realm in their entire life, a few awakens during adulthood, most awakens during their adolescence, some awakens before puberty, while there those who are born with an innate, immature Mana Realms which are extremely rare.

As Mana Realms purify mana from the atmosphere or other sources, the mana properties are modified to match the most dominant mana properties already present inside the mana realm. Thus, if your internal mana has highest affinity to fire attribute when your Mana Realm awakened, that will not change unless extraordinary conditions are met.

So much for that...

The more I read about magic, my interests towards it grow, taking it as far as setting future goals to taking proper magic education and becoming a true mage. I've never felt this level of excitement before, makes me wish I awaken my Mana Realm soon.

Things that helped me go out of my boredom came and go. There were times when I liked bedtime stories, but I later lost interest on them because my parents kept repeating some stories many times over. Even on reading books, I was already losing a fraction of my interest. Practical learning was more of what I've hoped for and I wouldn't mind doing it over and over, just to acquire more applicable knowledge.

Good thing, my mom sometimes take me out with her to visit the city. The first time was when I found out that the house I've been living in for more than a year is merely two kilometers outside the city of Camerote. More astonishingly, I also found out that my mother is not only kind and gorgeous but a capable mage as well, I guess. It was my first time being carried by a real-life flying angel.

I promised myself being good to my mom so she'll teach me some of her magic later. I hope something like that works.

While optimistic, I did my best to study the view of Camerote city. The city was completely medieval style, I've expected enough after learning a bit about this world.

As my mother visited a few places in the city, like shops, there were times when I felt sudden shifts in the atmosphere around us while she carried me in her arms. Enough to make me notice, those barbarian-looking males with revealed tatoos would hurriedly flee the street in the sight of my mom. It was completely the opposite of what I've expected from them. They all just fled when my mother walked nearby them. I don't know why but they all have traces of dread in their eyes and faces when my mother appears. This was when I later assumed my mother to be someone incredible and... scary...

Of course, people who wear protective gears, carrying various weapons, never escaped from my observant eyes. They were all around the city and I assumed they are either of the four: Soldiers, Adventures, Hunters, and Mercenaries. Whilst I assumed those who carry some sort of 'wand' or staff, sometimes wearing loose robes, were the typical mages that I know, doing magic like Harry Potter does.

Anyway, my mom keeps talking, telling me about what I see around the city, which I'm always happy to hear.

As always, the market place is the last place we visit before going home. There, I learned about this world's main currency and how much are their values. Ten coins of nickel—the form of currency with lowest value—was enough to buy a kilogram of pork meat. It turned out that the currency of this world is quite simple: A hundred nickel coins is equal to a gold coin, and a hundred gold coins is equal to an Ammelite plate—a half-palm-sized rectangular plate with golden barcode-like markings made from pure lustrous green mineral called Ammelite which is saturated by mana, very resistant to corrosion, and something that didn't exist in my previous world...

Pretty much, my life as little child revolved around learning and planning for my future of in this second life...
